<h2>Championships with the Miami Heat</h2>
<p>On July 8, 2010, LeBron James decided to leave the Cleveland Cavaliers to
join the Miami Heat and unite with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. In his first season
with the Miami Heat, the trio had an outstanding career as everyone expected.
Although they had a great run, they fell short losing to the Dallas Mavericks
in the 2011 NBA Finals. The following year, LeBron seeked redemption and there
was no way he was going to lose twice in a row in the finals. LeBron earned his
first two championships winning back to back in the year of 2012 and 2013. LeBron
James then again appeared in the 2014 Finals but lost to the San Antonio Spurs
causing him to go back home to Cleveland.</p>
<h2>Championship with the Cleveland Cavaliers</h2>
<p>In the year of 2014, LeBron returned to the Cavaliers with a promise of
  bringing a championship back home to Cleveland. He made another appearance
  in the 2015 NBA Finals to make his 5th consecutive year. The year didn't quite
  end the way he expected losing to the Golden State Warriors. LeBron wanted to
  keep his promise so he then again made it to the 2016 Finals. Just like his first
  year with Miami, there was no way on Earth he was losing the finals twice to
  the Warriors. LeBron finally received his 3rd ring bringing the championship
  home back to Cleveland just like he said he would.</p>
